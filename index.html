            <p> I grew up in Cadillac, and lived there for more than 18 years! I love coming back to visit! 
                Although it may appear as any other small town, there's actually lots of fun stuff to do and see!         
            </p>
            <p>Cadillac is a great city for those who love water activities - growing up, 
                I spent countless hours playing in Cadillac's 2 lakes (Lake Mitchell and Lake Cadillac)
            </p>

                Cadillac only has one high school, and it is pretty small (my graduating class was somwhere in the upp 100s). The school is connected to the
                Jr. High School which faces Lake Cadillac!
            </p>
            <p>
                I think Cadillac is a great combination of small town and city. It has a small town community feel, where you know your neihgbors and peers
                . It also is  not  too far from bigger cities like Traverse City and Grand Rapids.
