        <p>I grew up in Cadillac, and I love coming back to visit! Although it may appear as any other small town, there's actually lots of fun stuff to do and see! </p>
        <p>Cadillac is a great city for those who love water activities - growing up, I spent countless hours playing in Cadillac's 2 lakes (Lake Mitchell and Lake Cadillac)</p>
        <p>I think it is a great harmony of both small town community and getting to enjoy the outdoors
            while not being too far from bigger cities like Traverse City and Grand Rapids.
